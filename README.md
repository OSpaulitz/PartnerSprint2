Hello.  This is the first attempt.  Those files did not work but are here for posterity.

The first attempt at the microservice was a lot of trial and error.  
The final push uses my partners driver.py and a trial database to test that the microservice works.

The method cooklog allows to add a cooked on date with the format: "recipe_name recipe_date" from the CLI user input
The method getcooklog pulls the log of a recipe object and returns a string of comma separated dates of when a cook date was logged in the CLI
